h1. Linen

Linen aims to be a compact, modular, readable, fast textile translator for JavaScript.  Outside of a javascript runtime, it has no dependencies.  It's suitable for embedding in an html document for rendering a live preview of textile content, or for use on the server with a runtime like node.js.  

At this point, it's mostly complete.  There are some issues with how it handles lists (you can't specify any attributes on them), and it doesn't do footnotes or extended blocks yet, but it's usable at this point.
