h1. Linen

Linen aims to be a compact, modular, readable, fast textile translator for JavaScript.  Outside of a javascript runtime, it has no dependencies.  It's suitable for embedding in an html document for rendering a live preview of textile content, or for use on the server with a runtime like node.js.  

At this point, a large portion of textile syntax is implemented, but it is by no means complete.
